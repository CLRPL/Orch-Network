# Pycoin
Pycoin is a DApp for writing, testing and deploying mathematically verifiable secure smart contracts in python language that behave exactly as intended.

Unlike etherium smart contracts with a history of repeated hacks and stolen funds, hundreds and millions of dollars, Pycoin ensures that no run time errors or intentional/unintentional bugs can be used as expolits to steal funds and corrupt Pycoin smart contracts.
